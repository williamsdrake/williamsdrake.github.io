## <i class="fas fa-laptop-medical"></i> Oral barrier composition in health and disease
{% capture text %}
We employ a systems biology approach to better understand homeostasis at the oral barrier, and importantly, how homeostasis is disrupted in inflammatory disease (periodontitis).
Using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, histology and flow cytometry, we have identified:  
- stromal cells are defined by inflammatory signatures in health which are exacerbated in disease
- novel stromal-immune interactions that potentially drive oral mucosal inflammation in disease  

We are actively working to improve our understanding of these potential interactions at the protein and RNA level.

## <i class="fas fa-bacteria"></i> Host-microbe interactions in the oral mucosa
{% capture text %}
Relatively little is known how host cells respond to specific bacterial antigen and non-specific bacterial stimuli at the oral barrier.
To determine how the innate and adaptive immune system responds to bacterial and fungal stimuli, we are:  
- using flow-cytometry-based bacterial/fungal cell sorting and 16S/ITS sequencing to characterize taxa-specific coating of the oral microbiota with immunoglobulin 
- developing tools to assess T-cell specific responses to known oral pathogens

## <i class="fas fa-syringe"></i> Mucosal immunity in mendelian disease
{% capture text %}
The Moutsopoulos Lab sees several cohorts of patients that have single gene mutations which lead to severe oral disease. Using single cell sequencing, we are assessing how experimental treatment influences cell composition and gene expression in:
- patients with a gain-of-function mutation in *Stat1*, which causes chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and severe oral ulcers
- patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency 1 (LAD1), which causes severe gingival immunopathology leading to early-life tooth loss
