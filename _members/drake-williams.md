I am a dentist scientist with an interest in host-microbe interactions and oral barrier immunity. I received DDS (2017) and PhD (2019) degrees, both from the UCLA School of Dentistry, for studying the role of host inflammation and the commensal microbiota in the pathogenesis of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw, under the advisement of Dr. Reuben Kim. My DDS/PhD studies were supported in part by the NIDCR F30 NRSA Predoctoral Fellowship. I am currently a Clinical Research Fellow at NIDCR in the laboratory of Dr. Niki Moutsopoulos. My main focus in the Moutsopoulos lab is to use systems biology, applying single cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and high-dimensional cytometry to study mucosal immunology at the oral barrier, with a specific focus on understanding how the immune system contributes to the pathogenesis of common and mendelian forms of periodontal disease.
